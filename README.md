# RetrogradeOS-Reentry
A mostly (only for now) ASM Rebuild of RetrogradeOS

# Instructions

first install `nasm` and `qemu-system-i386` from your distro repository or if your running windows don't forget to enter WSL.

next clone this repository or downlaod the zip file and run `make` or for the bleeding edge run `make proto`.
then run `./qemu.sh` or `./qemu-proto.sh`.
